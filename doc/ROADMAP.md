# Long-Term Vision

codebase-snapshot aims to become a **repository intelligence engine**
that explains:

- what is in a codebase
- how the repository is structured
- how components interact
- where execution begins
- what the repository is designed to do
- how the repository operates internally

The goal is to allow both humans and AI systems
to understand software systems quickly and deterministically.
